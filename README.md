# Doggos, Ladders, Slides, U-turns (DLSU)
A turn-based console board game inspired by the classic **Snakes and Ladders**. This offline game features a 10 x 10 grid-based board with tiles numbered 1 to 100, designed for 2 to 5 players. The objective is simple: race from the starting tile (1) to the finish (100), navigating the board while overcoming or benefiting from the game's unique mechanics.

Unlike traditional Snakes and Ladders, DLSU introduces an exciting mix of elements—doggos, ladders, slides, and U-turns—that randomly appear throughout the board. These elements can help or hinder players' progress, adding an unpredictable and fun twist to the game. The first player to reach tile 100 wins, but the path to victory is full of surprises!
