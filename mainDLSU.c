/**
 * Description: This program is titled "Doggos, Ladders, Slides, and U-Turns" (DLSU). 
 * It is a machine project created as a course requirement for Logic Formulation and Introductory Programming (CCPROG1). 
 * The game is a modern Command-Line Interface (CLI) turn-based offline board game inspired by the traditional Snakes and Ladders board game. 
 * Like Snakes and Ladders, it features a board with a 10 x 10 grid of tiles numbered from 1 to 100. 
 * 
 * Players participate in a Spartan race with an exciting twist in this board game. 
 * Instead of the traditional snakes and ladders, the game features dogs, ladders, slides, and U-turns that can appear randomly on different tiles. 
 * These elements can assist or hinder players navigating the board to reach tile 100. 
 * The first player to land on this tile is declared the winner.
