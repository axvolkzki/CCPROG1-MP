# Doggos, Ladders, Slides, U-turns (DLSU)
A console-based application titled "Doggos, Ladders, Slides, and U-Turns" (DLSU) is an offline board game inspired by the traditional Snakes and Ladders board game that features a board with a 10 x 10 grid of tiles numbered from 1 to 100 for 2-5 players.

Players participate in a Spartan race with an exciting twist in this board game. Instead of the traditional snakes and ladders, the game features dogs, ladders, slides, and U-turns that can appear randomly on different tiles. These elements can assist or hinder players navigating the board to reach tile 100. The first player to land on this tile is declared the winner.
