Like the Snake and Ladders, which has a board with a grid of 10 x 10 tiles from 1 to 100. This board game is a simple race game with a plot twist; instead of only snakes and ladders, the objects are the doggos, ladders, slides, and u-turns and may randomly appear on a tile that can help or hinder the player in navigating the board to achieve their goal,to reach tile 100. The first player to reach the goal is the winner.
